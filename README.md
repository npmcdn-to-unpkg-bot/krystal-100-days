# #100DaysOfCode

## About
Inspired by [E. Wilson](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-took-on-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-here-are-my-results-8e442f56d750#.gjh3nrykn) and [Richard Littauer](https://medium.com/@richlitt/100-days-of-code-5e9a4dc6d56b#.ll6rtbu05), I’m beginning my own 100-day challenge. Though I’m good about taking the time to watch tutorials and read books, I don’t sit down and practice what I learn often enough. I feel this challenge will not only motivate me slow down and thoroughly understand what I learn, but will expose me to tools like Git that I don’t use at work. 

## Rules
I will spend at least 30 minutes a day coding. I will write a [TIL](http://codeseeders.com/category/today-i-learned/) post to track my daily progress and I will commit my code every day (unless I am not authorized to do so for proprietary reasons). Watching tutorials, though fun, does not count as coding time.
